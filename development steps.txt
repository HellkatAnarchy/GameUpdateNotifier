#Create a window into which we can add an appid and then get the version number from.
#Get the current version of the appid from the JSON.
#Save the appID to a file
#Find out why we can't get the version number for many games.
#Using http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamNews/GetNewsForApp/v0002/?appid=391220&count=3&maxlength=300&format=json
#works much better. We'd have to go through the results and do "If feedname = "steam_community_announcements", 
#and if the latest result like that isn't the last one (We'd store gid), then pop up a notification.
#The downside of this is that many games just wont update thier news. Still, we will go ahead this way.
#Add appid's to extension window.
#Allow removal of appid's from storage.
#Make the spacing nice on the apps displayed.(It's close)
